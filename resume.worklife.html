            <p>            I was born and currently reside in Vancouver, British Columbia. However, my love for exploring different cultures and countries has led me on extensive journeys throughout Europe and South Asia. Witnessing the beauty and diversity of these regions has been truly captivating, and it has enriched my understanding of the world.
            </p>
            <p>            From time to time, I find myself contemplating profound questions about existence and the potential future of consciousness in the universe. It's a thought-provoking exploration that fascinates me and encourages me to delve into the mysteries of life.
            </p>
            <p>            In terms of work experience, I have spent many years in customer service and sales roles, ranging from casual to high-end restaurants. This has honed my interpersonal skills and provided me with a strong foundation in delivering exceptional service to customers.
            </p>
            <p>            Additionally, I have also worked remotely as a business administrator for a year and a half. During this time, I successfully led daily online meetings, ensuring effective communication and collaboration among team members. I remained focused on exceeding the expected weekly output and demonstrated strong organizational skills.
            </p>
            <p>            In terms of programming, I have already reached a proficient level where I can tackle a wide range of programming tasks using various tools and resources. I am continually striving to enhance my efficiency and expand my skill set. As a result, I am seeking a junior position that will provide opportunities for growth and enable me to further develop and apply my programming abilities.</p>
        </p>
        <p>In my spare time, I enjoy improvising music, writing poetry and playing chess at the beach. It's a creative outlet that allows me to express my emotions and thoughts in a unique and personal way. </P>
